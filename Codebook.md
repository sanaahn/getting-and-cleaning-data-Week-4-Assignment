Codebook  discusses the variables, the data, the transformation, and any other work that was done to clean up the data for the Coursera data science course
"Getting and Cleaning Data."Carried out to obtain the data set based on the source data are presented in the Transformations section.

A single data set by combining the test and training set s created to read the files.

Then examine the tables by reading training and test tables.

Read the feature vector and assign the names of the variables. 
After that merge the data into a single data set by removing unusable data and keeping the average and standard deviation for each measurement 

Read the names of variables to create a vector in which the ID, mean, and standard deviation are defined.
From the merged data set, create the necessary subsets. Data collecting activities are given descriptive activity titles. 

Create a second, separate tidy dta containing the average of each variable and suitably name the variables in the data set (activity and subject) making a text file
containing a second batch of tidy data. The code assumes that the names haven't been altered and that all the data is in the same place, uncompressed. 

In terms of variables:

The variables x train, y train, x test, y test, subject train, and subject test held data from files. For further analysis, 
the previous datasets are integrated into x data, y data, and subject data.

Here are the data for the project:
